        <div id="story">
            <h2 style="color: #FF7343">CONTEXT</h2>
            <p>In January of my internship at the Cornell Tech Policy Lab, I was tasked to create a new 
                social media app geared towards college students. Working closely with 3 other designers 
                and engineers, I designed <strong>Pavvilion</strong> which provides a centralized location for students 
                to find opportunities, meet people with similar interests, and find clubs and 
                organizations that fit their preferences.
            </p>

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <img src = "images/timeline.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>
            <p>
                I’ve been designing Pavvilion in three phases — the MVP, Iteration 2, and Iteration 3 
                before the full release in Fall 2022 — in order to make sure that we have the chance 
                to iterate on our work multiple times based on user feedback. In this case study, I’ll 
                be focusing on how I worked on developing the <strong>MVP</strong> (Minimum Viable Product).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="user-research">
            <h2  style="color: #FF7343">USER RESEARCH</h2>
            <p>
                Since the task was very broad, it was important to gain a better understanding of the social 
                scene on campus and the challenges that students face in trying to navigate it. We conducted
                 several interviews with individuals at Cornell and other colleges. Our goals were to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Understand how users make friends and find people who share the same interests</li>
                <li>Discover how students find information on campus as underclassmen vs. upperclassmen</li>
                <li>Uncover pain points and product opportunities</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <img src = "images/pav_keyfindings.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>

            <h3>Understanding the User</h3>
            <p>
                To really understand the target users better, I created a couple of personas so that 
                I could relate more to the user’s needs, wants, thoughts, and priorities.
            </p>

            <img src = "images/pav_personas.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>

            <p><strong>Upperclassmen Student</strong> (Clarrissa)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have an established friend group on campus and are part of clubs that relate to their interests</li>
                <li>Want to get to know more people but are less likely to take the initiative to reach out</li>
                <li>Find out about opportunities on campus by word of mouth or based on who they follow on social media</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Underclassmen Student</strong> (Chris)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are actively looking to meet new people and are willing to go through competitive club recruitment processes to find interest groups</li>
                <li>Will go out of their way to reach out to people in class or from clubs to meet up with them</li>
                <li>Find out about opportunities on campus via campus events (like Club Fair) or based on posters/signs</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="people-problem">
            <h2  style="color: #FF7343">THE PEOPLE PROBLEM</h2>
            <p>
                Students want to meet new people that share their interests and find new opportunities
                 on campus but it’s difficult because:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>There is no centralized location on campus to find information (multiple social media
                     sites, physical advertising on campus, word of mouth)</li>
                <li>Don’t have a way to gage competitiveness, culture, or commitment level of a club</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div id="brainstorming">
            <h2  style="color: #FF7343">EXPLORING SOLUTIONS</h2>
            <h3>1) Coffee Chats</h3>
            <p>
                Students who share similar interests are paired together for a weekly coffee chat
            </p>

            <img src = "images/coffee_chat.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>

            <h3>2) Interest Groups</h3>
            <p>
                Students can join group chats based on the topics that they are most interested in (e.g. 
                a group chat for country singers)
            </p>

            <img src = "images/groups.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>

            <h3>Information Board</h3>
            <p>
                Students and clubs can post any information that can be seen by the entire college community
            </p>

            <img src = "images/info_board.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>

            <h3>Pursuing a Solution</h3>
            <p>
                I initially loved the coffee chats feature, as it makes learning about a new club or making
                 new friends a more personal experience where you are guaranteed to have interests in 
                 common with whom you are matched with. After I sketched out more ideas though, I felt
                  that the information board best solves the challenge that students are facing on campus.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, I decided to move forward with the <strong>INFORMATION BOARD</strong> because:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    It gives both <strong>upperclassmen</strong> a platform to spread the word about information 
                    more quickly and <strong>underclassmen</strong> a way to quickly learn about information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It can <strong>minimize the amount of apps</strong> users open use as they research clubs or look 
                    for other opportunities or information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It caters to students with content that is <strong>student-driven</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provides insight into <strong>non-tangible aspects</strong> that students look for like club culture
                     and commitment level.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div id="determining-content">
            <h2  style="color: #FF7343">DETERMINING CONTENT FOR THE MVP</h2>
            <p>
                In order to make it easier for the engineers on the team to build and to give us 
                multiple opportunities to iterate based on user feedback, we worked on creating 
                a minimum viable product that only contains the key features for the app.
            </p>

            <img src = "images/pav_content.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>

            <p>
                <em>Since I was working with a team of designers, my role was to build the home page 
                    and profile page as well as contribute a few things to the design system and login sequence.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                After determining the content, I considered the information architecture for the MVP 
                and created a chart to map out how the user would get from one page to the next and 
                how each feature would be integrated into the interface of the app.
            </p>

            <img src = "images/pav_flow.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>
        </div>

        <div id="home-page">
            <h2  style="color: #FF7343">DESIGNING THE HOME PAGE</h2>
            <p>
                After understanding the content requirements as well as the three different main 
                pages and their hierarchy, I explored different ways that the posts could be displayed
                 on the information board.
            </p>

            <img src = "images/pav_dec1.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="image"/>

            <p>
                Explorations <strong>A & B</strong> were very similar to other popular social media platforms such as 
                Instagram and Facebook, but they made it more difficult for a user to quickly 
                explore different posts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, I decided to pursue <strong>Option C</strong> because the small size of the post prioritizes discovery 
                and exploration. However, I decided to keep option A in the case the user wants to click 
                on a post and view it in more detail.
            </p>

            <p>
                After exploring layouts, I considered different visual styles for the homepage.
            </p>

            <img src = "images/pav_dec2.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="image"/>

            <p>
                We wanted the mood of the app to be fun and casual, het geared towards Cornell's pre-professional culture.
                 I eliminated <strong>A</strong> since it felt more formal and slightly more professional, and didn’t 
                 fit best with the mood we were aiming for while <strong>B</strong> didn’t feel professional enough.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, I decided to go with <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong> since they were fun and casual but did not look unprofessional. 
                <strong>Option C</strong> is what we built for the MVP and <strong>Option D</strong> will be used for Iteration 3 (it is more 
                difficult to code for our engineers), since it builds on some of Pavvilion’s other UI 
                elements like the waves and color tagging system, found in the login sequence.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once I determined the best layout and visual style for the homepage, I explored 
                different ways of displaying a single post.
            </p>

            <img src = "images/pav_dec3.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="image"/>

            <p>
                I eliminated <strong>C</strong> because depending on the picture, it was difficult to read the text overlay 
                and some users did not associate the caption with the correct post. <strong>A</strong> did not fit with
                 the mood of the app — it looked more formal instead of fun. Farther down the line, <strong>B</strong>
                  could contribute to content moderation issues since the name of the individual is
                   not associated with the post.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>D</strong>, <strong>E</strong>, and <strong>F</strong> all fit the visual style and mood of the app the best. I decided to go with 
                <strong>Option D</strong> since it does not contain tags. If the user puts several tags on one post, 
                this would be difficult to display well on the post since it is so small on the screen.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="profile-page">
            <h2  style="color: #FF7343">DESIGNING THE PROFILE PAGE</h2>
            <p>
                When designing the profile page, there were two profiles to consider — club profiles
                 and individual profiles. I started with <strong>club profiles</strong>.
            </p>

            <img src = "images/pav_dec4.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="image"/>

            <p>
                I considered the content requirements for the club profile page and decided to focus on 
                items that would help provide a brief overview of the club so that the user could make
                 a decision based on just the profile if they’re interested in attending an event.
            </p>

            <p>
                Afterwards, I considered 3 explorations. I eliminated B because the 
                gradient made it difficult to read the icons and the text overlaid on top. 
                <strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong> both provided a summary for the club, but C made it easier for a 
                user to scan since the text size was bigger and the icons made information 
                such as the acceptance rate easy to recognize. Thus, I chose <strong>Option C</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next, I focused on building the <strong>individual profile</strong>.
            </p>

            <img src = "images/pav_dec5.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="image"/>

            <p>
                As for the club profile page, I considered both the content requirements and a few 
                different explorations. Initially, I included year, major, and hometown in the content
                 requirements but decided to replace it with a short bio instead so that users 
                 could choose what information they wanted to present about themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
                I eliminated <strong>B</strong> as the color and position of the follow button doesn’t draw the user’s 
                attention to it, and it doesn’t come across as the most important button on 
                the page. 
                I eliminated option <strong>A</strong> because it would require the user to scroll a lot to view several posts,
                making it difficult to quickly determine whether or not you'd like to follow someone.
                Although option <strong>C</strong> was visually the most appealing, it was difficult
                 for our engineers to build. For this reason, I went with <strong>Option D</strong>.

            <p>
                Since I worked with a team of designers, I focused on creating a couple of pages within
                the login sequence - the main page and the "select your interests" page. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I eliminated <strong>A</strong> as I felt that the different shades of orange did not 
                tie together well with our branding guidelines. I eliminated <strong>D</strong> because
                the two gradients distracted from the main logo in the center of the page, which I wanted
                to highlight the most. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Although I liked the incorporation of the waves in option <strong>B</strong>
                especially since it fits with one of our featured UI elements, I felt that the main screen
                did not stand out enough, especially in comparison with the other screens in the login sequence.
                To address this, I used the waves in all other pages of the login sequence. Ultimately, though I decided
                to go with <strong>Option C</strong> since it fit best with our branding, equally emphasizes login and
                signup, and makes the logo the main focus.
            </p>

            <p>
                After designing the main page, I exploring different ways for users to select their interests
                during the initial sign up sequence.

            <p>
                I initially created option <strong>B</strong>, but eliminated it because of technical constraints -
                it would be too difficult to code, especially in the first iteration of the app. I eliminated option
                <strong>A</strong> because it made all of the tags look selected (even though they weren't) and limited
                the number of tags that we could display to a small amount. <strong>Option C</strong> provided the most flexibility for
                a user to select from a wide variety of interests, which is why I ended up choosing it.

            <p>
                Once our team decided on a final visual style, I helped create a design system 
                with colors, typography, buttons, icons, logos, and UI elements.

                Here are the wireframes for the final MVP (some of the design decisions such as those 
                for the home page will be implemented in iteration 2 once the engineers finish setting 
                up a basic template for most of the app).

                This was my first time building an app from scratch — starting with user research
                all the way to determining branding and launching. Through this process,
                 I learned how important it is to be able to justify every design decision 
                 and that oftentimes the first solution you come up with is going to be very 
                 different from the one you end up with as you continue to iterate. As our
                  engineers finish up building the MVP, Pavvilion will be launched for beta
                   testing within the next month as we continue to build on the later iterations 
                   and implement the full scope of features that we initially decided for the app.
