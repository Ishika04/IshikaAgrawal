                        <p>
                            During my summer internship at Amazon, I worked on two projects as part of the FinTech team.
                            The first project was to create a centralized repository that makes it easier for customers
                            to learn about payment related products and services. The second project was to create a new
                            product that helps teams automate the process for addressing tickets and issues that arise
                            during the payments process.

                        <h3>Advocating for the User </h3> 
                        <p>
                            As I balanced the needs and expectations of the product manager and engineers, I learned
                            how to advocate for the user. I improved at explaining the reasoning behind
                            design decisions and supporting my decisions with evidence from user testing and/or 
                            user research.
                        </p>
        
                        <h3>Design for Technical Feasability</h3>
                        <p>
                            For my first project when I was improving an existing product, I learned
                            that my design while in theory, worked well for the user, had potential to worsen the user 
                            experience as it would significantly slow down run time. I learned to expand my 
                            technical considerations and think about things such as number of queries to the database. 
                        </p>
        
                        <h3> Thinking Long-Term </h3> 
                        <p>
                            As I worked on my second project which involved designing a product from scratch, I 
                            learned how important it is to plan long-term and envision what the product could be
                            six months to two years from now.
