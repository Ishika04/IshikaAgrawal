                <h1>Google Classroom</h1>

                <p>This March, schools across the country switched to remote learning as a result of the pandemic.
                    For my younger sister, a highly motivated, straight-A high school student, the transition
                    was a struggle. She was constantly overwhelmed with notifications, missed assignment deadlines,
                    and found it difficult to communicate with her teachers.
                </p>
            
                <p> Before the pandemic, teachers could easily support students in the classroom. <em> Now, students 
                    have a lot less support than they’re 
                    used to. </em> It’s up to them to wade through an average of <strong>30+</strong> Google Classroom notifications a 
                    day to find that one reminder, shoot that first email when they’re falling behind, and keep 
                    themselves organized. <em>To solve this problem, I designed the <strong>Bulletin Board </strong>feature to allow 
                    teachers to more easily support and motivate students as schools switch to online learning.</em>
                </p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                <h3>Get feedback early and often </h3> 
                <p>
                    At first, I would ask for user feedback only
                    once I felt that the designs were the absolute best I could make them. This meant that when I did
                    get feedback, I had to make a lot of changes. Now, I try to get feedback even if I feel my work
                    isn't yet complete. 
                </p>

                <h3>Design is nonlinear</h3>
                <p>
                    Oftentimes, I had to go back a couple steps
                    when I realized that perhaps there was a different way of approaching things or that there were
                    new constraints I had to take into account. Frequently iterating means having to go back sometimes.
                </p>

                <h3> Don't need to reinvent the wheel </h3> 
                <p>
                    I spent a lot of time breaking down existing
                    design patterns, especially within the Google Classroom app in order to make sure that the UI was
                    consistent. Even as I added new features, I realized that I could shape existing design patterns
                    to fit the user's needs.

            <h2>Understanding the User</h2>
            <p>I conducted user research interviews, selecting a diverse set of users in order to 
                understand pain points in the Google Classroom app for both students and teachers. 
            </p>

            <h3>The 5 User Archetypes</h3>
            <p>
                I found that users 
                tended to fit into 5 main categories - the student leader, the athlete,
                the average student, the experimenter, and the average teacher.
            </p>

            <img src = "images/gc-archetypes.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>

            <h3>Empathizing with the Target User</h3>
            <p>
                To design for students of diverse backgrounds and uses of Google Classroom, I created personas 
                to highlight key needs and frustrations of users.

                    <h2>Understanding the Current Google Classroom App</h2>
                    <p>
                        Currently, Google Classroom tackles one part of the problem by allowing the user to manage all 
                        of their posts and notifications via the to-do list feature and the assignment stream. <em>However, 
                        Google Classroom’s current solution lacks organization.</em> Here are some of the pain points:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Too Much Technical Overhead</h3>
                    <p>
                        The assignment stream contains all posts from announcements to assignments, causing comments 
                        and discussion threads to get lost. This means that assignments that are due soon also get buried 
                        in the assignment stream, causing students to miss them. Thus, organization is a time consuming 
                        process.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Existing Features are Difficult to Find</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are several features that Google Classroom offers to organize assignments -
                        the To Do List, filtering by unit, and aggregating graded/missing assignments. However,
                        <strong>42%</strong> of users interviewed did not know about the To Do List feature and
                        <strong>63%</strong> did not know about the filtering features.
                    </p>

                    <p>These pain points cause students to organize their assignments like this instead:</p>

                Through the user research interviews, I gained a lot of insight into the key issues
                that users face when working with the Google Classroom app.

            <h3>Pinpointing the Main Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Students want to feel motivated in school and keep up with their coursework but it’s 
                difficult because:
            </p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>There are too many posts and assignments to manage in order to stay organized</li>
                <li>There is a lack of interaction and support between students and teachers</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
            
    
        <div id="brainstorming">
            <h2>Exploring Possible Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                I began by conducting a brainstorming session that involved a variety of methods including
                generating how might we questions and building an affinity diagram with potential solutions
                for each individual problem identified.
            </p>

            </div>  
        
            <h3>Narrowing Down to 3 Solutions</h3>
            <p>After brainstorming, I decided to narrow down on 3 potential solutions:</p>

            <img src = "images/gc-lofi.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="image"/>

            <!-- <h3>How Might Users Interact with these Solutions?</h3>
            <p>Using the user archetypes and personas I had developed before, I considered how each user might interact
                with the different solutions and tried to decide which would work best for the wide range of users
                that Google Classroom serves.
            </p> -->
        </div>

        <div id="bulletin-board">
            <h2>Moving Forward with the Bulletin Board</h2>
            <p>
                I decided to move forward with the <strong>Bulletin Board feature</strong> because it not only helps
                students who are already motivated, but makes it easier for struggling students to get organized
                without additional effort on their part. I also 
                decided to <em>redesign the layout of the Classwork Tab</em> so that it prioritizes assignments 
                that are due soon and keeps the assignment stream solely for announcements and materials,
                thereby creating support.
            </p>

            <p>Below is a quick overview of the new features and changes: </p>

        <div class="gc-classworktab">
            <h2>How Can We Reduce Time Users Spend Searching For Assignments?</h2>
            <p>I addressed this question by redesigning the Classwork Tab and re-prioritizing it as the the first page 
                page a user sees when they enter the class instead of the assignment stream. As I created the new design,
                 here are some of the things I considered: 
            </p>

            <h3>Determining What is Due Next</h3>
            <p>
                Older assignments get buried under newer assignments in the Assignment Stream or within large units 
                in the Classwork Tab, causing students to miss them. I worked to simplify the process of determining 
                what is due next by highlighting
                assignments due soon and adding options to hide assignments due far in the future.
            </p>

            <h3>Providing More Content to Reduce Time Searching for Details</h3>
            <p>
                Through user research, I found
                that the current tab does not provide enough information about each individual assignment - students have 
                to click on every assignment individually to find out when it is due, what the assignment requires, and
                if anyone has responded to a comment they might have left. I aimed to reduce the number of steps by 
                providing more content per assignment.
            </p>

            <h3>Simplifying the Process of Accessing Older Assignments</h3>
            <p>
                Google Classroom's current tools to sort through older assignments are not visible and missed by 
                most students as evident through user research. I made these tools more visible and integrated them with a 
                search bar to help students find things faster. 
            </p>

            <img src = "images/gc-classworkbreakdown.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>

            <h3>Previous Iterations</h3>
            <p>
                Before designing this final solution, I went through several different iterations where I considered the 
                content requirements for the classwork tab, hierarchy for the page, and visual design styles.
            </p>

            <p>Here are some of my explorations:</p>
            <img src = "images/gc-classworkexplore.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small" style="min-width: 100%;"/>
        </div>

        <div class="gc-bulletinexplan">
            <h2>How Can We Make the Bulletin Board As Easy to Digest And Access As Possible?</h2>
            <p>
                Previously, there was no place for a user to view a summary of all of their classes that highlights
                only the most important information. Whether your looking for an assignment due right away or an
                important reference material, you had to search through the assignment stream. The Bulletin Board
                summarizes the information on the main page and the Classwork Tab. As I was created the design for 
                it, here are some of the things that I considered:
            </p>

            <h3>Regulating the Amount of Information</h3>
            <p>
                For user research, teachers pack a lot of information into their announcements and assignments.
                The Bulletin Board is only effective if there's a way to regulate how many posts there are and 
                how concise those posts are.
            </p>

            <h3>Sorting and Categorizing Information</h3>
            <p>
                There's a lot of information in the Bulletin Board, especially when you see all of them 
                on the main page. Users need to be able to navigate this information quickly by scanning
                and being able to separate out what's important.
            </p>

            <img src = "images/gc-bulletinexplan.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>

            <h3>Previous Iterations</h3>
            <p>In previous iterations, I considered a variety of entry points for the Bulletin Board,
                different layouts that make it easier/harder to scan, dealing with different edge cases
                (too many posts or too many words per post), adding a new post, and what a user sees 
                when they click on an individual reminder.

            <h2>Final Prototypes</h2>
            <p>
                Here are my final prototypes for what the student and teacher interactions would look like
                with the Bulletin Board feature:

                    <source src="images/teacher-side.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                    <h3>The Teacher Interface</h3>

            <h2>If I were to continue the project, what would I focus on next?</h2>
            <p>
                In the midst of the pandemic, our lives completely shifted to a virtual world 
                and there were several problems that came with that. It was empowering to be 
                able to use design to be able to solve a relevant problem during this time that
                so many students and teachers are struggling with.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I continued the project, I would want to focus more on finding ways to better assimilate
                the Bulletin Board feature in Google Classroom and continue with user testing.
            </p>
            <h3> 
                HMW integrate reminders into the announcement stream to function as 
                more “urgent” announcements?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Since the Bulletin Board is meant to highlight only important information, teachers might feel
                limited by it's use overtime. I would want to explore how we can prioritize items within the 
                announcement stream so that teachers can bring attention to certain announcements that might not
                be urgent currently but are something that they want students to keep in mind. One example of this 
                might be pinning a class discussion about a certain chapter in the book that everyone is discussing.
            </p>

            <h3>
                HMW bring some of the elements from the new Classwork Tab into the 
                To-Do List feature to make it easier for students to use?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Many of the design changes that I made came from feedback on the to-do list and other features 
                that already exist within Google Classroom. I would want to explore how we can use this feedback 
                to further iterate on these features so that they serve students better.
