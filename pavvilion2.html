                        <p>
                            In February of my internship at the Cornell Tech Policy Lab, I was tasked to create a new 
                            social media app geared towards college students. Working closely with a team of designers 
                            and engineers, I helped design <strong>Pavvilion</strong> which provides a centralized location for students 
                            to find opportunities, meet people with similar interests, and find clubs and 
                            organizations that fit their preferences.

                        <h3>Iterate Quickly and Often </h3> 
                        <p>
                            At first, my co-designer and I worked on trying to create the "perfect" design, which led us to
                            getting stuck such that our designs weren't evolving fast enough. Once we started focusing on 
                            quantity rather than quality, I found that the quality also improved as we came up with many 
                            new ideas for the designs that we hadn't thought of before.
                        </p>
        
                        <h3>Design for Engineering Feasability</h3>
                        <p>
                            Oftentimes, I had to go back to simplify the UI to ensure that the engineers would be able 
                            to keep up with the timeline when building the MVP. I learned that in the first iterations 
                            especially, feasability should be emphasized in the designs.
                        </p>
        
                        <h3> Consistency is Key </h3> 
                        <p>
                            This was the first time that I'd worked extensively with another designer to create a product.
                            Because my partner and I had such different styles, it was important to make sure that 
                            our final designs were consistent. It was helpful to establish a design system 
                            and guidelines early on.

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>
                    My co-designer and I worked together on all aspects on the design, discussing each of the different 
                    pages and how to approach the designers for them. However, we had slightly different focus areas 
                    within the project. I focused more on developing the home screen and some of the profile pages early on 
                    and she helped solidify the visual design styles, branding, and UI later on in the project.

                <h3>Timeline</h3>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I’ve been designing Pavvilion in three phases — the MVP, Iteration 2, and Iteration 3 
                    before the full release in Fall 2022 — in order to make sure that we have the chance 
                    to iterate on our work multiple times based on user feedback. In this case study, I’ll 
                    be focusing on how I worked on developing the <strong>MVP</strong> (Minimum Viable Product).

                <h2  style="color: #FF7343">Understanding the User</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the task was very broad, it was important to gain a better understanding of the social 
                    scene on campus and the challenges that students face in trying to navigate it. We conducted
                     several interviews with individuals at Cornell and other colleges. Our goals were to:
                </p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand how users make friends and find people who share the same interests</li>
                    <li>Discover how students find information on campus as underclassmen vs. upperclassmen</li>
                    <li>Uncover pain points and product opportunities</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Mapping the User Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    After conducting user research interviews, I considered how the user's experience evolves as they 
                    go through the entire process of searching for clubs and events, recruitment, keeping up with 
                    club events, and advertising events. I identified the user's thoughts, emotions, key pain points, and 
                    opportunity areas for Pavvilion to address.

                <p>
                    To really understand the target users better, I created a couple of personas so that 
                    I could relate more to the user’s needs, wants, thoughts, and priorities.

                <ul>
                    <li>Have an established friend group on campus and are part of clubs that relate to their interests</li>
                    <li>Want to get to know more people but are less likely to take the initiative to reach out</li>
                    <li>Find out about opportunities on campus by word of mouth or based on who they follow on social media</li>

                    <li>Find out about opportunities on campus via campus events (like Club Fair) or based on posters/signs</li>

            <div id="people-problem">
                <h2  style="color: #FF7343">Pinpointing the Problem</h2>

                <p>
                    After learning how students currently interact and learn about 
                    on campus clubs and events through user research interviews, I learned that 
                    there are several pain points in this process. <em>Here are some of the key issues:</em>
                </p>

                <h3>Club and Event Information is Scattered</h3>
                <p>
                    There is no centralized location on campus to access all of the information you need. Students 
                    learn about clubs and events via social media (Facebook, Reddit, Instagram), campus events (Club Fair, tabling 
                    events), word of mouth, and physical advertising (flyers, posters, chalk on sidewalks). Because the process
                    of finding these clubs is spontaneous and not systematic, 
                    students have a hard time finding groups and events that fit their interests.
                </p>

                <h3>Hard to Gage Club Culture</h3>
                <p>
                    Before students decide to go to an event or join a club, there's a lot of information that they 
                    consider than can be difficult to gage without interacting with members themselves. Some of these 
                    items include commitment level, competitiveness, extent of collaboration, how close-knit members are,
                    mentorship opportunities, and other intangible qualities that are difficult to measure. 
                </p>

                <h3>Campus Involvement Requires Extensive Planning</h3>
                <p>
                    Attending club events or hosting events requires a lot of planning to advertise. To advertise, 
                    students have to make designs, contact other organizations, and consider how they'll advertise 
                    across platforms. For attendees, they have to keep track of event dates and find people to go with. 
                    And during recruitment especially, they keep track of application deadlines, interview dates, and events. 
                </p>
            </div>
    
            <div id="brainstorming">
                <h2  style="color: #FF7343">Exploring Possible Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                    Before brainstorming with the team, I first looked into existing solutions within the market to
                    understand what other solutions do well and where they fall short.
                </p>

                <h3>Considering Existing Market Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                I looked at both companies that directly address the main problem such as CampusGroups and ClubView as well as 
                those that indirectly solve this such as Reddit and Facebook.
                </p>

                <img src = "images/pav-companalysis.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>

                <br>
                <p>
                    Through this analysis, I learned that there's no product in the 
                    market that centrally serves all of the needs that student leaders who are recruiting and students 
                    who are searching for clubs/events.
                </p>

                <h3>Narrowing Down to 3 Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                    After brainstorming, I decided to narrow down on 3 potential solutions:
                </p>
                <br>

                <p style="font-size: 17px;"><strong>1) Coffee Chats</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Students who share similar interests are paired together for a weekly coffee chat
                </p>
    
                <img src = "images/coffee_chat.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;"><strong>2) Interest Groups</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Students can join group chats based on the topics that they are most interested in (e.g. 
                    a group chat for country singers)
                </p>
    
                <img src = "images/groups.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;"><strong>3) Information Board</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Students and clubs can post any information that can be seen by the entire college community
                </p>
    
                <img src = "images/info_board.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>
    
                <h3>Pursuing a Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    I initially loved the coffee chats feature, as it makes learning about a new club or making
                     new friends a more personal experience where you are guaranteed to have interests in 
                     common with whom you are matched with. After I sketched out more ideas though, I felt
                      that the information board best solves the challenge that students are facing on campus.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Thus, I decided to move forward with the <strong>INFORMATION BOARD</strong> because:
                </p>
    
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        It gives both <strong>upperclassmen</strong> a platform to spread the word about information 
                        more quickly and <strong>underclassmen</strong> a way to quickly learn about information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It can <strong>minimize the amount of apps</strong> users open use as they research clubs or look 
                        for other opportunities or information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It caters to students with content that is <strong>student-driven</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provides insight into <strong>non-tangible aspects</strong> that students look for like club culture
                         and commitment level.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <p>
                    In order to make it easier for the engineers on the team to build and to give us 
                    multiple opportunities to iterate based on user feedback, we worked on creating 
                    a minimum viable product that only contains the key features for the app. All of the other 
                    features will be implemented in ongoing iterations.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src = "images/pav-content.jpg" alt = "Cover Pic" class="small"/>
                <br>
    
                <p>
                    Our main focus was on developing the information board and the profiles because they 
                    help consolidate most of the information that used to scattered on multiple platforms.
                </p>

                <br>
    
                <p>
                    After determining the content, I considered the information architecture for the MVP 
                    and created a chart to map out how the user would get from one page to the next and 
                    how each feature would be integrated into the interface of the app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After understanding the content requirements as well as the three different main 
                    pages and their hierarchy, I explored different ways that the posts could be displayed
                     on the information board.
                </p>

                <h3>How Many Posts Makes the Page Easiest to Explore?</h3>
                <p>
                    The first thing I considered was how many posts would be ideal so that a user could quickly explore 
                multiple posts while also ensuring that the user doesn't get overwhelmed by the amount of content.

                        <li>Small size of the post prioritizes discovery 
                            and exploration</li>
                        <li>Provides details when combined with Option A so that a user can click to see more</li>

                <h3>What Visual Style Best Fits the Mood of the App?</h3>
                <p>
                    After exploring layouts, I considered different visual styles for the homepage. We wanted the mood of the 
                    app to be fun and casual, yet geared towards Cornell's pre-professional culture.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Both conveyed a fun and casual mood while looking more professional than B</li>
                        <li>C was built for the MVP</li>
                        <li>D will be built for Iteration 3 since the color-coded waves are slightly more difficult to code</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    <strong style="font-size: 17px;">A & B:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>A felt too formal and slightly more professional than the other options</li>
                        <li>B didn't feel professional enough</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    In the future, we will add items to the home page such as a system to search by recommended tags,
                    but they are currently not technically feasible within the timeline for the MVP.

                    Once I determined the best layout and visual style for the homepage, I explored 
                    different ways of displaying a single post.

                        <li>Fits the mood of the app well and uses distinguishing UI elements like the waves</li>

                <p>
                    When designing the profile page, there were two profiles to consider — club profiles
                     and individual profiles.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Club Profiles that Consolidate Information From Multiple Social Media Platforms</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I considered the content requirements for the club profile page and decided to focus on 
                    items that would help provide a brief overview of the club so that the user could make
                     a decision based on just the profile if they’re interested in attending an event.

                        <li>Cleaner layout that fits minimal look of the app</li>

                <p>
                    As for the club profile page, I considered both the content requirements and a few 
                    different explorations. Initially, I included year, major, and hometown in the content
                     requirements but decided to replace it with a short bio instead so that users 
                     could choose what information they wanted to present about themselves.

                    After designing the main page, I exploring different ways for users to select their interests
                    during the initial sign up sequence.

                        <li>Most flexibility for a user to choose a variety of interests</li>
                        <li>Makes it easier to select by sorting into categories</li>

                        <li>B is the most visually appealing but was eliminated due to engineering constraints</li>

                    Once our team decided on a final visual style, I helped create a design system 
                    with colors, typography, buttons, icons, logos, and UI elements.

                    This was my first time building an app from scratch — starting with user research
                    all the way to determining branding and launching. Through this process,
                     I learned how important it is to be able to justify every design decision 
                     and that oftentimes the first solution you come up with is going to be very 
                     different from the one you end up with as you continue to iterate. 
                </p>

                <h3>User Testing & Iterating Based on Feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the last few weeks, we have have started conducted user testing. Based on the feedback 
                    that we have been receiving, we will continue to iterate on the app and address any of the
                    issues that come up.
                </p>

                <h3>Flesh Out Features for Iteration 2</h3>
                <p>
                    For each iteration, we came up with a least of new features that we were going to implement. 
                    The next steps are to expand on the MVP and build in the new features that were originally 
                    planned.
